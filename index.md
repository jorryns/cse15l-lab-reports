In the bash terminal, type in "$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu" where zz is replaced by the letters in your course specific account

You will get a message saying the Authenticity of host cant be extablished, type in yes to continue and press enter.

Next it will ask you for a password, type in the password you set earlier in this step and log in.

# Step 3: Running Commands

There are many commands that you can use both on your computer and the remote computer in order to highlight the differences.

For example cd~ 

On your computer it should bring you to here:

(Windows) C:\Users\user

But on the remote computer it should bring you to here:

"/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/cs15lwi2zz"

You can try next try cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt in order to get this output:

"Hello! Welcome to CSE15L"
